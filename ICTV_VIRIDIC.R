# when running the following lines of code, R will give error message that the vector ids is empty
# and at that point accnsp/entrez_search returns 0 hits - stops at Icerudivirus SIRV3
# after specieslist[19] there are "0" values in tax_lineagsp
# if accnsp$count == 0 then that means there were no hits found for that specific species - these also will be in tax_lineagsp
# and will not start with Viruses as they did not go through the entrez_fetch function
# There are species in the ICTV master species list that result in no hits found when running entrez_search()

# writing out the fasta files for specieslist[1] and specieslist[2]
# if accnsp$count == 0 then that means there were no hits found for that specific species
