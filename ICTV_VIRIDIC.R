# Moving Forward: need to address this issue when retrieving accession IDs and fasta sequences
# Note: entrez prints error message when loop through many species
# To-do: How to have entrez retrieve sequences for all species

#in order to install devtools
#in command line, run the following commands -
  #sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
  #sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
  #sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
  #sudo apt install r-cran-devtools
#to install reutils - install.packages("reutils")

library(reutils)
library(devtools)
library(rentrez)

# when running the following lines of code, R will give error message that the vector ids is empty
# and at that point accnsp/entrez_search returns 0 hits - stops at Icerudivirus SIRV3
# after specieslist[19] there are "0" values in tax_lineagsp
# if accnsp$count == 0 then that means there were no hits found for that specific species
# There are species in the ICTV master species list that result in no hits found when running entrez_search()

# this is the count function
# this is a loop to see how many of the 9110 species give out 0 hits from NCBI
# and how many species have hits from NCBI


# Rhea: Attempting to use esearch (from reutils package) for this for-loop. Having issues and consistently getting errors `Warning: HTTP error: Status 500;`
# accnsplist <- esearch(specieslist, db = "nuccore", rettype = "count", retmax=length(specieslist))
# esearch does have 'count' funcitonality which would make this process easier (hopefully)


# this is writing out the fasta sequences - modify this to write out the tax_recsp IDs to a text file where each species accession IDs is a new line
#Jacob: added above request, still getting stuck when species has 0 hits from NCBI. If we can get above for loop to run faster, then we can add in an if statement to
#second for loop to exclude species if it has 0 matches

# Sidra:
# this stores species from specieslist[i] that have accnsplist$count == 0 - completed

# have to search for the species that yield 0 hits from NCBI

# Next Steps: use NCBI created accession number list from ICTV database as batch search NCBI to get equivalent fasta and add to database
# Next Next Steps: VIRIDIC with in-house database to run user input fasta sequence and determine similarities
