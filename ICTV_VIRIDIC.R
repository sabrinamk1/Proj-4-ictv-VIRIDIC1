# There are several R libraries that need to be installed for this documentation.
# In order to install `rentrez`, there are two ways:
  # install.packages('rentrez') OR 
  # install_github("ropensci/rentrez")
    # This way will provide the latest version.
library(rentrez)

# In order to install devtools, run the following commands in command line -
  #sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
  #sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
  #sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
  #sudo apt install r-cran-devtools
library(devtools)

# In order to install reutils, in R - install.packages("reutils")

# Moving Forward: need to address this issue when retrieving accession IDs and fasta sequences
# Note: entrez prints error message when loop through many species
# To-do: How to have entrez retrieve sequences for all species

# when running the following lines of code, R will give error message that the vector ids is empty
# and at that point accnsp/entrez_search returns 0 hits - stops at Icerudivirus SIRV3
# after specieslist[19] there are "0" values in tax_lineagsp
# if accnsp$count == 0 then that means there were no hits found for that specific species
# There are species in the ICTV master species list that result in no hits found when running entrez_search()

# this is the count function
# this is a loop to see how many of the 9110 species give out 0 hits from NCBI
# and how many species have hits from NCBI


# Rhea: Attempting to use esearch (from reutils package) for this for-loop. Having issues and consistently getting errors `Warning: HTTP error: Status 500;`
# accnsplist <- esearch(specieslist, db = "nuccore", rettype = "count", retmax=length(specieslist))
# esearch does have 'count' funcitonality which would make this process easier (hopefully)

# Taking the csv file created using `PandasSpeciesGetCSV.py`,
  # This file has the list of species names from the ICTV Master Species List
specieslist <- read.csv("/home/rprag/species.csv")
length(specieslist[[1]])
# This should return as 9110
# Rhea is working on using this for the analysis

# this is writing out the fasta sequences - modify this to write out the tax_recsp IDs to a text file where each species accession IDs is a new line
#Jacob: added above request, still getting stuck when species has 0 hits from NCBI. If we can get above for loop to run faster, then we can add in an if statement to
#second for loop to exclude species if it has 0 matches


# this stores species from specieslist[i] that have accnsplist$count == 0 - completed

specieslist <- ictvxl$Species
# accnsplist$count is the number of IDs returned from searching a species
# this loops through the specieslist and if the count of ids is 0 then it appends the species to the specieszero12.txt file
# The specieszero12.txt file has 318 species and can use this to filter out/remove species from the specieslist so that we don't
# have to search for the species that yield 0 hits from NCBI

# Next Steps: use NCBI created accession number list from ICTV database as batch search NCBI to get equivalent fasta and add to database
