# note: this calculation formula is taken from VIRIDC
#intergenomic distance calculation
# idAB = identical bases when genome A is aligned to genome B
# idBA = identical bases when genome B is aligned to genome A 
# lA = length genome A 
# lB = length genome B
# simAB = intergenomic similarity between genomes A and B
# distAB =  intergenomic distance between genomes A and B


#simAB = ((idAB + idBA) * 100)/(lA + lB)
# distAB = 100 - simAB
# in order to calcualte intergenomic distance we need the following from our blast output:
# output need: 


CODE:

# first we want to read the sampleblastoutA.txt file 
# then read the sampleblastoutB.txt file 


#text file A and text file B




#r = open ("sampleblastoutB.txt", 'r')
#for line in r:

# dictionary w/ tuples as keys

# ex-     dictionary1 = {(g1,g2):id ; (g2,g1): id)}


    # k1 and k2 are seq ids

    # v = integer 

# make dictionary
dictionary1 = {}

with open ("sampleblastoutB.txt") as f:
    for line in f: 
        k1,k2,v,r = line.split()
