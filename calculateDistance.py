#text file A, text file B (has reciprocal of A)

#we want dictionary w/ tuples as keys

#example: dictionary1= {(g1,g2): nident ; (g2,g1): nident)}

    #g1 and g2 are sequence ids

    #nident = integer

#now, make dictionary

#dictionary1 will be our main dictionary which will have tuples as keys

#note: dictionary1 holds the nident (number of identities) as values paired with
# the 2 keys which the keys are query and subject.

#note: dictionary2 will simply be to store the length of each seqID because seq
# length is necessary to calculate intergenomic distance


#step1: make dictionary1 and dictionary2
dictionary1 = {}
dictionary2= {}

#step2: add to dictionary1 the keys as tuples and values the nident
  #also, add to dictionary2 the key as seqid, the the value as length
