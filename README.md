### Introduction
This builds a database that simplifies the process of classifying new viral sequences per ICTV classifications. The database is a multi-fasta file with fasta sequences for each ICTV designated species.

#### ICTV Master Species List
ICTV publishes a Master Species List every year which includes the new additions and updates to viral taxonomy. The complete list of files can be found [here](https://talk.ictvonline.org/files/master-species-lists/m/msl) on the ICTV website. The database currenty uses [ICTV Master Species List MSL #37](https://talk.ictvonline.org/files/master-species-lists/m/msl/13425) which was published in April 2022.

#### Virus Repository Resource
ICTV also publishes a developing resource that includes key pieces of information such as viral taxonomy, GenBank accession numbers, RefSeq IDs, and exemplar isolates. The complete list of files can be found [here](https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/vmr/) on the ICTV website. The database currently uses [Virus Metadata Repository MSL 36](https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/vmr/m/vmr-file-repository/13181) which was published in October 2021. 

### Installation and Dependencies

#### User Requirements
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) ([RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) is optional)  
- Install pandas package for distance calculations: ```sudo apt install python3-pandas```
- Install seaborn package to make heatmap: ```pip install seaborn```
- Install dependencies for installing rentrez:
    - ```sudo apt-get install libssl-dev```
    - ```sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev```
    - ```sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev```
    - ```sudo apt install r-cran-devtools```
- Install rentrez:
    - ```install_github("ropensci/rentrez")``` 

#### BLAST
- commands to download and install current version of BLAST for linux server

```sudo apt-get update```

```sudo apt-get install ncbi-blast+```

- to check that it is correctly installed type

```blastn help```

#### User Instructions
1. Run below code to download necessary run files from github
- ```sudo apt install subversion```
- ```svn checkout https://github.com/ssohail1/Proj-4-ictv-viridic/trunk/run```
2. Copy/move your input fasta into the run folder, and modify the user path in the run.py code
- A sample input fasta is included, so by default the code will be run with that data
3. Once in the downloaded folder, run the lines of code below
- ```python3 run1.py```
- ```python3 run2.py```

### Pipeline
1. Download the Master Species List from ICTV website: [Master Species List 2020](https://talk.ictvonline.org/files/master-species-lists/m/msl/12314)
2. Download the Virus Metadata Repository from ICTV website: [Virus Metadata Repository 2021](https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/vmr/m/vmr-file-repository)
3. Run the VMR python script for parsing the ICTV Virus Metadata Repository excel file where output is a csv file
4. Run the Pandas python script for parsing the ICTV Master Species List excel file where output is a csv file
5. This csv file will be input to R for retrieval of sequences from NCBI using the rentrez package
6. BLASTn the user fasta with inhouse database
- Explanation for sampleblastout A and B, such as column information, can be found in terminalblast.txt
7. Calculate intergenomic similarity distance from BLAST output
- Get total nident by removing overlapping HSPs in BLAST output
- Use total nident and other variables output from BLAST to calculate intergenomic similarity distance
8. Next Steps: 
    - We can have the class machine run this Rscript in the background with nohup and using the & option
    - Retrieve the accession ids for all species that yield greater than 0 hits from NCBI searches
    - Retrieve the fasta sequences by doing a search with all accession ids as input
    - Parse through the fasta sequence output to only save fasta sequences that start with ">NC_" in the header
#### Input

#### Output

#### Limitations
The ICTV Master Species List and Virus Metadata Resource are updated on a yearly basis. It will be integral to download and implement the **most recent** version to return an accurate output. 

Furthermore, the wrapper does not include species from the Master Species List that did not return hits from NCBI. These are excluded from the tool and put into a separate text file for the user. 

The tool is also limited to distance calculations. While the BLAST does alignment, anything beyond distance calculations is not explored. It will be up to the user to how they want to address their questions.
